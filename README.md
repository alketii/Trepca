# Trepca
A 2D mining game to find the ultimate book of alchemy hidden deep in the mine

The game currently is WIP and has a big way to be complete

You will need GDSqlite module [GDSqlite](https://github.com/khairul169/gdsqlite)

Since the world generation its too slow, I used python with sqlite3, for the moment, generation works only on Linux, If for some reason it doesn't work, naviagte to world/ and click world_gen binary file.

For other sytems, you can run world/world_gen.py , you will need python-sqlite3 installed.
